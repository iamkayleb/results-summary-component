- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

I got to learn more about gradients and shapes with this part of the project.

```css
.circle {
    max-width: 180px;
    background: radial-gradient(circle at bottom, hsla(241, 72%, 46%, 0),hsla(256, 72%, 46%, 1)100%  );
    padding: 50px;
    margin: 50px auto;
    font-family: 'Hanken Grotesk', sans-serif;
    border-radius: 50%;
}
```




### Continued development
I wish to go more in-depth in CSS and improve on styling and responsiveness. I also wish to learn more on Javascript to help me accomplish the bonus task.
